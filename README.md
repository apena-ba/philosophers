## Description
The goal of this project is making a simulation of the philosophers problem, where the philosophers must die under certain conditions and live under other ones. The program takes as parameters the number of philosophers, the time to live, the time to eat, the time to sleep and an optional parameter being the amount of times a philosopher has to eat to stop his simulation.

The bonus part is the same simulation, using multi process concurrency instead of multi threading.

The educational significance is handling concurrency, improving knowledge in threads, mutexes, processes, semathores and data racing
